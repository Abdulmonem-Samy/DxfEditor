this python program handling a problem in the DXF files (DXF files is a 2D CAD files). 
that files have something called bend notes to told the bend machines which angle 
and direction of bending of each line have to be bended in the file.
the bend notes in those DXF files produced from the CAD programs are not readable for the bend machines. 
and have to be edited in specific form to be readable for the bend machine.
The Mechanical Engineers (and I am one of them) in the company where I was working were have to open each file 
on a CAD program like AutoCAD and edit each bend note in the DXF file. That was time consuming process and consume efforts too. 
For that I have created that python program to open all DXF files in the source folder and edit the pend notes inside 
it and save the edited new DXF files in the destination folder automatically. And thatâ€™s save time and efforts.
